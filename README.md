# PDF to Speech Application

A very small application that first reads PDF files using PyPDF2 and then creates audio speech for the text.

The PDF reader is choppy and I am interested in finding other libraries or learning how to use this one more effectively. 

The text to speech library seems solid and has options to change rate and volume.
